description: 'To set the runtime status of the <code>kernel.kptr_restrict</code> kernel

ocil: "The runtime status of the <code>kernel.kptr_restrict</code> kernel parameter\
  \ can be queried\nby running the following command:\n<pre>$ sysctl kernel.kptr_restrict</pre>\n\
  The output of the command should indicate a value of <code>1</code>.\nThe preferable\
  \ way how to assure the runtime compliance is to have\ncorrect persistent configuration,\
  \ and rebooting the system.\n\nThe persistent kernel parameter configuration is\
  \ performed by specifying the appropriate\nassignment in any file located in the\
  \ <pre>/etc/sysctl.d</pre> directory.\nVerify that there is not any existing incorrect\
  \ configuration by executing the following command:\n<pre>$ grep -r '^\\s*kernel.kptr_restrict\\\
  s*=' /etc/sysctl.conf /etc/sysctl.d</pre>\nIf any assignments other than\n<pre>kernel.kptr_restrict\
  \ = 1</pre>\nare found, or the correct assignment is duplicated, remove those offending\
  \ lines from respective files,\nand make sure that exactly one file in \n<code>/etc/sysctl.d</code>\
  \ contains <code>kernel.kptr_restrict = 1</code>, and that one assignment\nis returned\

rationale: 'Exposing kernel pointers (through procfs or <tt>seq_printf()</tt>) exposes

  kernel writeable structures that can contain functions pointers. If a write vulnereability
  occurs

  in the kernel allowing a write access to any of this structure, the kernel can be
  compromise. This

  option disallow any program withtout the CAP_SYSLOG capability from getting the
  kernel pointers addresses,

  replacing them with 0.'
