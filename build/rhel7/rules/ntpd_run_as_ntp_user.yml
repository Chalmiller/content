description: "ntp is a daemon which implements the Network Time Protocol (NTP). It\
  \ is designed to\nsynchronize system clocks across a variety of systems and use\
  \ a source that is highly\naccurate. More information on NTP can be found at\n\n\
  \    <a xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml' href='http://www.ntp.org'>http://www.ntp.org</a>.\n\
  ntp can be configured to be a client and/or a server.\nTo ensure that ntpd is running\
  \ as ntp user, Add or edit the\n<tt>OPTIONS</tt> variable in <tt>/etc/sysconfig/ntpd</tt>\
  \ to include ' -u ntp:ntp ':\n<pre>OPTIONS=\"-u ntp:ntp\"</pre>\nThis recommendation\
  \ only applies if ntp is in use on the system."

  run the following commands:

  <pre>$ sudo grep "^OPTIONS" /etc/sysconfig/ntpd</pre>

  The output should contain

  is working properly. Running ntpd under dedicated user accounts limits the attack

  potential attacker exploiting security flaws in the daemon or the protocol.'
