rationale: 'Using an authentication device, such as a CAC or token that is separate
  from

  the information system, ensures that even if the information system is

  compromised, that compromise will not affect credentials stored on the

  authentication device.

  <br /><br />

  Multifactor solutions that require devices separate from

  information systems gaining access include, for example, hardware tokens

  providing time-based or challenge-response authenticators and smart cards such

  as the U.S. Government Personal Identity Verification card and the DoD Common

  Access Card.'
