description: 'The rpcgssd service manages RPCSEC GSS contexts required to secure protocols

  that use RPC (most often Kerberos and NFS). The rpcgssd service is the

  client-side of RPCSEC GSS. If the system does not require secure RPC then this

  service should be disabled.


  The <code>rpcgssd</code> service can be disabled with the following command:

  <pre>$ sudo systemctl mask --now rpcgssd.service</pre>'
