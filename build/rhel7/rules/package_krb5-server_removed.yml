description: 'The <tt>krb5-server</tt> package should be removed if not in use.

  Is this system the Kerberos server? If not, remove the package.

  The <code>krb5-server</code> package can be removed with the following command:

  <pre>

  $ sudo yum erase krb5-server</pre>

  The krb5-server RPM is not installed by default on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7

  system. It is needed only by the Kerberos servers, not by the

  clients which use Kerberos for authentication. If the system is not

  intended for use as a Kerberos Server it should be removed.'
