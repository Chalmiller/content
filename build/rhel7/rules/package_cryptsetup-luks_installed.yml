rationale: 'LUKS is the upcoming standard for Linux hard disk encryption. By providing
  a standard

  on-disk format, it does not only facilitate compatibility among distributions, but
  also

  provide secure management of multiple user passwords. In contrast to existing solution,

  LUKS stores all necessary setup information in the partition header, enabling the
  user

  to transport or migrate their data seamlessly. LUKS for dm-crypt is implemented
  in

  <tt>cryptsetup</tt>. <tt>cryptsetup-luks</tt> is intended as a complete replacement
  for the

  original <tt>cryptsetup</tt>. It provides all the functionality of the original

  version plus all LUKS features, that are accessible by luks* action.'
