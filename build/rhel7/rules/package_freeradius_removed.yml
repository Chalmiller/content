description: 'The <tt>freeradius</tt> package should be removed if not in use.

  Is this system a RADIUS server? If not, remove the package.

  The <code>freeradius</code> package can be removed with the following command:

  <pre>

  $ sudo yum erase freeradius</pre>

  The freeradius RPM is not installed by default on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7

  system. It is needed only by the RADIUS servers, not by the

  clients which use RADIUS for authentication. If the system is not

  intended for use as a RADIUS Server it should be removed.'
