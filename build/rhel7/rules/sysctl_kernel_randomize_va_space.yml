ocil: "The runtime status of the <code>kernel.randomize_va_space</code> kernel parameter\
  \ can be queried\nby running the following command:\n<pre>$ sysctl kernel.randomize_va_space</pre>\n\
  The output of the command should indicate a value of <code>2</code>.\nThe preferable\
  \ way how to assure the runtime compliance is to have\ncorrect persistent configuration,\
  \ and rebooting the system.\n\nThe persistent kernel parameter configuration is\
  \ performed by specifying the appropriate\nassignment in any file located in the\
  \ <pre>/etc/sysctl.d</pre> directory.\nVerify that there is not any existing incorrect\
  \ configuration by executing the following command:\n<pre>$ grep -r '^\\s*kernel.randomize_va_space\\\
  s*=' /etc/sysctl.conf /etc/sysctl.d</pre>\nIf any assignments other than\n<pre>kernel.randomize_va_space\
  \ = 2</pre>\nare found, or the correct assignment is duplicated, remove those offending\
  \ lines from respective files,\nand make sure that exactly one file in \n<code>/etc/sysctl.d</code>\
  \ contains <code>kernel.randomize_va_space = 2</code>, and that one assignment\n\
  is returned when \n<pre>$ grep -r kernel.randomize_va_space /etc/sysctl.conf /etc/sysctl.d</pre>\n\

rationale: 'Address space layout randomization (ASLR) makes it more difficult for
  an

  attacker to predict the location of attack code they have introduced into a

  process''s address space during an attempt at exploitation.  Additionally,

  ASLR makes it more difficult for an attacker to know the location of

  existing code in order to re-purpose it using return oriented programming

  (ROP) techniques.'
