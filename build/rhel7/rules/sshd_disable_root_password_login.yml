title: Disable SSH root Login with a Password (Insecure)
warnings:
- {general: 'While this disables password-based root logins, direct root logins

    through other means such as through SSH keys or GSSAPI will still be

    permitted. Permitting any sort of root login remotely opens up the

    root account to attack.

    To fully disable direct root logins over SSH (which is considered a

    best practice) and prevent remote attacks against the root account,

    see CCE-27100-7, CCE-27445-6, CCE-80901-2, and similar.'}
