description: 'Make sure that the system is configured to limit the maximal rate for
  sending

  duplicate acknowledgments in response to incoming TCP packets that are for

  an existing connection but that are invalid due to any of these reasons:


  (a) out-of-window sequence number, (b) out-of-window acknowledgment number,

  or (c) PAWS (Protection Against Wrapped Sequence numbers) check failure

  This measure protects against or limits effects of DoS attacks against the system.

  Set the system to implement rate-limiting measures by adding the following line
  to

  <tt>/etc/sysctl.conf</tt> or a configuration file in the <tt>/etc/sysctl.d/</tt>
  directory

  (or modify the line to have the required value):

  <pre>net.ipv4.tcp_invalid_ratelimit = <sub idref="sysctl_net_ipv4_tcp_invalid_ratelimit_value"
  /></pre>

  Issue the following command to make the changes take effect:

  <pre># sysctl --system</pre>'

  of DoS

  attacks by ensuring implementation of rate-limiting measures

  on impacted network interfaces, run the following command:

  <pre># grep ''net.ipv4.tcp_invalid_ratelimit'' /etc/sysctl.conf /etc/sysctl.d/*</pre>

  The command should output the following line:

  <pre>/etc/sysctl.conf:net.ipv4.tcp_invalid_ratelimit = <sub idref="sysctl_net_ipv4_tcp_invalid_ratelimit_value"
  /></pre>

  The file where the line has been found can differ, but it must be either <tt>/etc/sysctl.conf</tt>

  or a file located under the <tt>/etc/sysctl.d/</tt> directory.'
