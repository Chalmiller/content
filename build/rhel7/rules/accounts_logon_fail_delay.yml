description: 'To ensure the logon failure delay controlled by <tt>/etc/login.defs</tt>
  is set properly,

  add or correct the <tt>FAIL_DELAY</tt> setting in <tt>/etc/login.defs</tt> to read
  as follows:

ocil: 'Verify the <tt>FAIL_DELAY</tt> setting is configured correctly in the <tt>/etc/login.defs</tt>
  file by

  running the following command:

  <pre>$ sudo grep -i "FAIL_DELAY" /etc/login.defs</pre>

  All output must show the value of <tt>FAIL_DELAY</tt> set as shown in the below:

  <pre>$ sudo grep -i "FAIL_DELAY" /etc/login.defs

  FAIL_DELAY <sub idref="var_accounts_fail_delay" /></pre>'
ocil_clause: the above command returns no output, or FAIL_DELAY is configured less
  than the expected value
