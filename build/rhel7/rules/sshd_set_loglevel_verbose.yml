description: 'The <tt>VERBOSE</tt> parameter configures the SSH daemon to record login
  and logout activity.

  To specify the log level in

  SSH, add or correct the following line in the <tt>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</tt> file:

  <pre>LogLevel VERBOSE</pre>'
identifiers: {cce: CCE-82419-3}
inherited_platforms: [machine]
ocil: 'To check if LogLevel is enabled or set correctly, run the

  following command:

  <pre>$ sudo grep "^LogLevel" /etc/ssh/sshd_config</pre>

  If configured properly, output should be <pre>LogLevel VERBOSE</pre>'

rationale: "SSH provides several logging levels with varying amounts of verbosity.\
  \ <tt>DEBUG</tt> is specifically\nnot recommended other than strictly for debugging\
  \ SSH communications since it provides\nso much data that it is difficult to identify\
  \ important security information. <tt>INFO</tt> or \n<tt>VERBOSE</tt> level is the\
  \ basic level that only records login activity of SSH users. In many\nsituations,\
  \ such as Incident Response, it is important to determine when a particular user\
  \ was active\non a system. The logout record can eliminate those users who disconnected,\
  \ which helps narrow the\nfield."
