rationale: 'The shosts.equiv files are used to configure host-based authentication
  for the

  system via SSH. Host-based authentication is not sufficient for preventing

  unauthorized access to the system, as it does not require interactive

  identification and authentication of a connection request, or for the use of

  two-factor authentication.'
