description: 'The audit system should collect access events to read audit log directory.

  The following audit rule will assure that access to audit log directory are

  collected.

  <pre>-a always,exit -F dir=/var/log/audit/ -F perm=r -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=unset
  -F key=access-audit-trail</pre>

  If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured to use the <tt>augenrules</tt>

  program to read audit rules during daemon startup (the default), add the

  rule to a file with suffix <tt>.rules</tt> in the directory

  <tt>/etc/audit/rules.d</tt>.

  If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured to use the <tt>auditctl</tt>

  utility to read audit rules during daemon startup, add the rule to

  <tt>/etc/audit/audit.rules</tt> file.'
