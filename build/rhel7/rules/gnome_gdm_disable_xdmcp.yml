  To disable XDMCP support in Gnome, set <code>Enable</code> to <code>false</code>
  under the <code>[xdmcp]</code> configuration section in <code>/etc/gdm/custom.conf</code>.
  For example:

  <pre>

  [xdmcp]

  Enable=false

  </pre>'

ocil: 'To ensure that XDMCP is disabled in <code>/etc/gdm/custom.conf</code>, run
  the following command:

  <pre>grep -Pzo "\[xdmcp\]\nEnable=false" /etc/gdm/custom.conf</pre>

  The output should return the following:

  <pre>

  [xdmcp]

  Enable=false

  </pre>'
ocil_clause: the Enable is not set to false or is missing in the xdmcp section of
  the /etc/gdm/custom.conf gdm configuration file

rationale: 'XDMCP provides unencrypted remote access through the Gnome Display Manager
  (GDM) which does

  not provide for the confidentiality and integrity of user passwords or the

  remote session. If a privileged user were to login using XDMCP, the

  privileged user password could be compromised due to typed XEvents

  and keystrokes will traversing over the network in clear text.'
