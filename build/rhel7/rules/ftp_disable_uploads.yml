  If not,

  edit the vsftpd configuration file to add or correct the following configuration
  options:

  <pre>write_enable=NO</pre>

  If FTP uploads are necessary, follow the guidance in the remainder of this section
  to secure these transactions

rationale: 'Anonymous FTP can be a convenient way to make files available for universal
  download. However, it is less

  common to have a need to allow unauthenticated users to place files on the FTP server.
  If this must be done, it

  is necessary to ensure that files cannot be uploaded and downloaded from the same
  directory.'
