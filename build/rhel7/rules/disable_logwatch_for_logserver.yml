description: 'Does your site have a central logserver which has been configured to
  report

  on logs received from all systems? If so:

  <pre>$ sudo rm /etc/cron.daily/0logwatch</pre>

  If no logserver exists, it will be necessary for each system to run

  Logwatch individually. Using a central logserver provides the security and

  reliability benefits discussed earlier, and also makes monitoring logs

  easier and less time-intensive for administrators.'
