description: 'Configure non-compliant accounts to enforce a 24 hours/1 day minimum
  password

  lifetime by running the following command:

  <pre>$ sudo chage -m 1 <i>USER</i></pre>'

ocil: 'Check whether the minimum time period between password changes for each

  user account is one day or greater by running the following command for

  each user:

  <pre>$ sudo chage -l <i>USER</i> | grep Minimum</pre>

  The output for each user should return something similary to the following:

  <pre>Minimum number of days between password change\t\t: 1</pre>'

rationale: 'Enforcing a minimum password lifetime helps to prevent repeated password

  changes to defeat the password reuse or history enforcement requirement. If

  users are allowed to immediately and continually change their password, the

  password could be repeatedly changed in a short period of time to defeat the

  organization''s policy regarding password reuse.'
