  login and management framework.


  The <code>cockpit</code> service can be disabled with the following command:

  <pre>$ sudo systemctl mask --now cockpit.service</pre>'
identifiers: {}
inherited_platforms: [null]
ocil: ' To check that the <code>cockpit</code> service is disabled in system boot
  configuration, run the following command: <pre>$ systemctl is-enabled <code>cockpit</code></pre>
  Output should indicate the <code>cockpit</code> service has either not been installed,
  or has been disabled at all runlevels, as shown in the example below: <pre>$ systemctl
  is-enabled <code>cockpit</code><br/> disabled</pre>

  Run the following command to verify <code>cockpit</code> is not active (i.e. not
  running) through current runtime configuration: <pre>$ systemctl is-active cockpit</pre>

  If the service is not running the command will return the following output: <pre>inactive</pre>

  The service will also be masked, to check that the <code>cockpit</code> is masked,
  run the following command: <pre>$ systemctl show <code>cockpit</code> | grep "LoadState\|UnitFileState"</pre>

  If the service is masked the command will return the following outputs:

  <pre>LoadState=masked</pre>

  <pre>UnitFileState=masked</pre>'
