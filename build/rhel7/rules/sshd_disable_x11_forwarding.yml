description: 'The X11Forwarding parameter provides the ability to tunnel X11 traffic

  through the connection to enable remote graphic connections.

  SSH has the capability to encrypt remote X11 connections when SSH''s

  <tt>X11Forwarding</tt> option is enabled.

  <br /><br />

  To disable X11 Forwarding, add or correct the

  following line in <tt>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</tt>:

  <pre>X11Forwarding no</pre>'

  the following command:

  <pre>$ sudo grep -i X11Forwarding /etc/ssh/sshd_config</pre>


  If a line indicating <tt>no</tt> is returned, then the required value is set.'

rationale: 'Disable X11 forwarding unless there is an operational requirement to use
  X11

  applications directly. There is a small risk that the remote X11 servers of

  users who are logged in via SSH with X11 forwarding could be compromised by

  other users on the X11 server. Note that even if X11 forwarding is disabled,

  users can always install their own forwarders.'
